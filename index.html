Step 2: Enter configuration name (Configuration name can be anything that user wants) 
<BR/>
User can enter a Description regarding the configuration to understand easily and it is optional.
<BR/>
The user will see the ‘Retry Count' field in which the initial value is Null. Retry Count is used to repeat the execution if there will be any error occurred in the execution while processing. Retry Count is a numeric field in which the user can provide a number. The number that the user enters in the Retry Count field that many times the execution will be repeated automatically. And if all the records get processed successfully and status gets Completed in the very first execution i.e Parent execution, it will not repeat the execution even if the user has added the value in the Retry Count field. 
In case Retry Count field is not empty and execution gets repeated then user can see Repeated Execution records in the ‘Retry Executions’ section.
   
<BR/>
Step 3: Select the “Delete Settings” [If a user selects any activity in Delete Settings, the records of that activity will be deleted after the data masking execution completes.]
<BR/>
After setting up all Delete Settings, click on the “Save” button.

2. Activate User:- 
<BR/>
When you create, refresh, or clone a sandbox, user email addresses are modified in your sandbox so that production users don’t receive automatically generated email messages from the sandbox. User email addresses are appended with .invalid.
<BR/>
If the user wants to activate the user. You need to pass the user's email id here. So that .invalid is removed
